# Cisco-Port-Security-Configuration
In this project, I  implemented port security on a Cisco switch to restrict unauthorized device access and mitigate MAC flooding attacks within a LAN environment. The configuration focused on enabling port security on access ports and enforcing violation responses when limits are exceeded.


✅ Key Features Configured 

FastEthernet0/1 as an access port


Enabled port security to restrict unauthorized access


Set the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses to 2


Configured violation mode to protect (blocks unauthorized MACs without shutting the port)


Designed for securing access layer switches in enterprise LAN environments
